## Projects
### Machine Learning - Churn Prediction
[Project](https://github.com/jsscb/machine-learning)

I built a classification model to predict customer churn by applying a robust preprocessing pipeline. The pipeline handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling to ensure data quality. I used both Random Forest and XGBoost for the modeling phase, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance. Cross-validation was employed to ensure the model's robustness, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC were used to evaluate model performance.


### Deep Learning - Stock Prediction
[Project](https://github.com/jsscb/deep-learning)

In this project, I built a deep learning model to predict stock prices for Facebook and IBM. The model utilized historical stock data, including features like closing prices, volume, and technical indicators. I implemented a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to capture temporal dependencies in the data and improve prediction accuracy. The model was evaluated based on metrics like RMSE, MAE and MAPE, demonstrating its potential for forecasting stock trends.
