## Projects (churn, rps)
### Machine Learning - Churn Prediction
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

I built a classification model to predict customer churn by applying a robust preprocessing pipeline. The pipeline handled missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling to ensure data quality. I used both Random Forest and XGBoost for the modeling phase, tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance. Cross-validation was employed to ensure the model's robustness, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC were used to evaluate model performance.


### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
